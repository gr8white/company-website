    <h1>Tacos & Coffee Lingo</h1>
    <h3>Debatable: Is a taco a sandwich??</h3>
    
    <div class="debate">
    <h4>Yes, a taco is a sandwich</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A tortilla is a form of bread</li>
            <li>Taco has filling in between just as a sandwich does</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="debate">
    <h4>No! It is not a sandwich..</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There's no bread</li>
            <li>Sandwich is a bunch of ingredients between 2 things (bread slices). Taco shell is only 1 thing.</li>
            <li>A taco is sideways orientated</li>
            <li>Like asking "Is cereal soup?"</li>
            <li>"A taco is not a sandwich. The sandwich is a culinary tool of Western European colonialism. The taco is a triumph for the Mexican working class." -Zach Carter</li>
            <li>"Not for nothing, but I think the taco probably came first... so is the sandwich a taco?" -Sujata Mitra</li>

    <h3>Fun Facts About Our Beloved Coffee:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shepherds discovered coffee in Ethiopia circa 800 A.D.
Legend has it that 9th century goat herders noticed the effect caffeine had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" after eating coffee berries. A local monk then made a drink with coffee berries and found that it kept him awake at night, thus the original cup of coffee was born.</li>
            <li>Coffee is the second most traded commodity on earth.
According to the Global Exchange, there are approximately 25 million farmers in over 50 countries involved in producing coffee. The number one commodity? Oil.</li>
            <li>There are two types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta.
Seventy percent of coffee beans are Arabica. Although less popular, Robusta is slightly more bitter and has twice as much caffeine.</li>
            <li>Coffee was originally a food.
Coffee berries were mixed with fat to create an energy-rich snack ball. It was also consumed as a wine when made from the pulp of coffee berries.</li>
            <li>Coffee is actually a fruit.
Coffee beans as we know them are actually the pits of a cherry-like berry that are grown on bushes. Even though coffee is actually a seed, it's called a bean because of its resemblance to actual beans.</li>
            <li>There have been five attempts to ban coffee throughout history.
Coffee was first banned in Mecca in 1511 because leaders believed it stimulated radical thinking. And, 16th century Italian clergymen tried to ban coffee because they believed it to be "satanic." However, Pope Clement VII loved coffee so much that he lifted the ban and had coffee baptized in 1600. But Ottoman leader Murad IV took it even further when he ascended the throne in 1623 by creating the first punishments for drinking coffee, which included beatings and being thrown into the sea.
In 1746, the Swedish government made it illegal to even have coffee paraphenalia, including cups and dishes. And finally, in 1777, Frederick the Great of Prussia issued a manifesto declaring beer's superiority over coffee because he believed it interfered with the country's beer consumption.</li>
            <li>You can overdose on coffee.
However, you would need to drink over 100 cups to consume the lethal dose of caffeine.</li>
            <li>Coffee drinkers have a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Researchers found that older patients with high levels of caffeine in their blood were more likely to avoid Alzheimer's. Studies have also shown that caffeine has positive effects on type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease. It has also been shown to protect against skin cancer in women.</li>
            <li>Just smelling coffee can wake you up.
A group of scientists reported that simply inhaling the aroma of coffee can alter the activity of some genes in the brain, reducing the effects of sleep deprivation. And when you do drink that cup of coffee, caffeine reaches your blood fast, like 10 minutes fast.</li>
            <li>Decaf does not mean caffeine-free.
An eight ounce brewed cup of decaf coffee actually has two-to-12 milligrams of caffeine. In comparison, a regular cup of coffee has anywhere from 95 to 200 milligrams. (Twelve ounces of coke only has 23-35 milligrams of caffeine.)</li>
            <li>Dark roast coffees have less caffeine than lighter roasts.
Even though the flavor is often stronger, roasting actually burns off some of the caffeine.</li>
